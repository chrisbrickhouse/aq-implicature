* Austin, E. J. (2005). Personality Correlates of the broader autism phenotype as assessed by the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). *Personality and Individual Differences, 38*, 451-460.
  * AQ administered to undergraduates.
  * Participants coded as three groups:
    * non-science (e.g., divinity, law)
    * biological science (examples include psychology, so perhaps includes social science)
    * hard science (heavy math component such as physics and math)
  * Participants parents occupation coded as substantial math content or not.

| Group              | Sample | Mean AQ | SD    |
| :----------------  | :---   | :-----: | :---: |
| Males              | 78/199 | 109.4   | 14.0  |
| Females            | 121/199| 104.1   | 13.5  |
| Hard Science degree| 44/198 | 112.2   | 18.4  |
| Bioscience degree  | 76/198 | 104.5   | 11.3  |
| Non-science degree | 78/198 | 104.6   | 12.3  |
| Science Parent     | 59/195 | 109.9   | 15.1  |
| Non-Science Parents| 136/195| 104.6   | 13.0  |

  * Investigate possible correlation between Ganong effect and AQ.
    * Ganong (1980) gave participants a lexical decision task of items on a continuum between words (kiss, gift) and non-words (giss, kift). Participants shifted their perceptual thresholds so as to preferentially perceive real words.
  * Considering Happé and Frith (2006)'s Weak Central Coherence Theory, authors predict participants with higher AQ will pay more attention to phonetic details and thus be less inclined to shift perceptual boundaries.
  * Found such a correlation ( r = -0.304, p < 0.05 ), participants with higher AQs were less influenced by top-down lexical information in decision tasks, showing reduced boundary movement.
  * The shift seems related to 'attention switching' and 'imaginiation' sub-scales fo the AQ.
  * AQ descriptive stats: Mean = 102 (of 200), Range = 71-150, SD = 14.5
