  <p class="block-text">In this task, you're going to help us understand what people really mean by their star ratings. We've anonymized all the ratings so you'll see a sentence like "When rating the food someone selected:" and then you'll see the ratings they gave. We'd like to know how much you agree with how particular descriptions fit those ratings. If you think the description fits exactly select "7 - Yes, definitely". If the description doesn't fit at all, select "1 - No, not at all." If you feel like it's somewhere in between these options, choose a number between 1 and 7.
