      <p class="block-text">In this task, you're going to help us understand what people really mean by their star ratings. We've anonymized all the ratings so you'll see a sentence like "When rating the food someone selected..." and then you'll see the rating they gave. Underneath the rating, you'll be asked whether or not you think a description fits the rating by answering "Yes" or "No."
